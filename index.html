                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am from King City, a small rural town about 35 minutes southeast of Maryville. I have lived in that area most of my life. I had a brief period a couple years ago where I lived in Panama City, Florida. My freshman year of college I bought DJ equipment and taught myself how to work it all.</p>

                <p>Music and computers have always been a passion of mine. I would love to work on music software, such as the ones I use to DJ.</p>
